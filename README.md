Data Analysis on International Migration in the US.

In this project we carry out exploratory analysis on the population dataset found [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data.aspx)

We get to notice the trend in international migrations, the places mostly migrated to for the past 9 years.
